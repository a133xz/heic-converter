This project is a wrapper of [this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heic-convert) using Electron. It was inspired by fellow Electron desktop app, [Image shrinker](https://github.com/stefansl/image-shrinker).

ðŸš€ **An important achievement** of this project is the boilerplate I've developed to create small **apps with Vue.js 3, Parcel 2, and Electron** very easily and quickly. There are powerful projects around, but no super simple approach.

ðŸ‘‰ So [check out the boilerplate](https://github.com/a133xz/electron-vuejs-parcel-boilerplate) if you're interested in creating a similar project.
